## Definitions

**Client Node** is an Aeternity node with no mining capability.

**Miner Node** is an Aeternity node with mining capability.

**Noise protocol** [Crypto protocol based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement](http://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html) that we use with [specific handshake](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/SYNC.md) (**XK**) and encryption (ChaCHaPoly).

**Node** (aka **Epoch node**) umbrella term for Aeternity protocol participant; includes miner nodes, client nodes, peers, etc.
Identified by a URI consisting of the protocol 'aenode://', the public key, an '@' character, the hostname or IP number, a ':' character and the Noise port number.  

**Connection** is a communication channel between two nodes peers. There is only one connection between each two peers.

**Peer Node** [is a node participating in a channel](https://github.com/Aeternity/protocol/tree/master/channels#terms).
**Penetration testing** (aka ***pentesting***) authorized simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the target system.
The test aims to identify the target's strengths and vulnerabilities, including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's software and data.  
**Predefined Epoch Node** This is a peer that is automatically connected to upon node startup.

**Spoofing** is an attack in which a person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

**State Channel** [is an off-chain method for two peers to exchange state updates](https://github.com/Aeternity/protocol/tree/master/channels#terms), each node can have multiple state channels and a pair of nodes can also have multiple channels between each other, which should be multiplexed over one connection. Epoch nodes come with a state channel web-service API as a reference implementation.

**Transactions** A transaction is an artefact that you post to the blockchain to alter its state. There are many kinds of transactions, e.g. to transfer tokens from one account to another, to create a contract, to query an oracle, etc.
If a transaction is syntactically incorrect it will just be ignored.
Syntactically correct transactions can be classified in 3 groups:
  * **Invalid** transactions are rejected by the validation algorithm. A reason could be that the nonce of a spend transaction is already used on chain, that the TTL (time-to-live) is less than the present height of the chain, etc.
	If the validation algorithm rejects a transaction, it is invalid.
  * **Unusable** transactions are rejected by the validation algorithm, because they cannot be used at the moment. However, they  can potentially be used in the future.
	For example, a transaction that spends more tokens than it has in the account is unusable, but can become usable a few blocks later if another transaction transfers money to it.
  * **Valid** transactions are accepted by the validation algorithm.
	They can be part of the next generated block. A miner is not forced to use a valid transaction in a generated block; miners are free to pick any number of valid transactions they prefer (e.g. depending on fees connected to them).


## System Model

The **system model** describes the high level view of the system and the context in which it is used.
It abstracts the details and allows to define the trust boundaries and state changes relevant to security.

General blockchain, allowing whatever actions on the blockchain.

Different from Bitcoin in that it has many more features and that it introduces oracles, name registration, contracts, state-channels and governance.
Higher transaction throughput possible than in Bitcoin, faster in 3 ways:  

		1. Faster block rate
		2. Bitcoin-NG technology with key-blocks and micro-blocks
		3. Off-chain state channels (micro-payments per second)

High-level features:

1. **Account**
	* **Public key on the chain + private key** - the blockchain does not handle the private keys of the users. Users are assumed to take care of their own keys; we trust the key generation code;
	* **Tokens** - each account holds a positive amount of tokens (aeons);
	* **Nonce** is a counter that increases upon every transaction.

2. **Contract language** a DSL for writing contracts.
3. **Oracle mechanism** ~ An oracle operator scans the blockchain for query transactions and posts answers to those queries to the chain.
4. **Naming service** - allows to claim a name;
5. **State channels** - allow offline transactions;
	* Opening and closing the channel [incurs fees](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/channels/README.md#incentives).
6. **Privacy** - currently a non-issue;
7. **Communication with nodes** - "seed" nodes provided by Aeternity, new nodes from the network through gossiping.
8. **Transaction fees**
This is a community blockchain, minimum fees are agreed upon by governance. Paying more than a minimum fee is possible and expected to be steered by the market.
9. **Governance**
There is a set of parameters, such as minimal transaction fee, that may be modified over the lifetime of the blockchain. Changes must be agreed upon by the majority of the community and governance is the mechanism to vote on the chain in favour or against changes.

=============================================

## Assets
**Assets** describe are the valuable data that the business cares about
1. **Private Keys** are of paramount importance, the "golden nuggets"; they uniquely identify epoch nodes and used to authenticate transactions.
2. **Password for key encryption** used to encrypt keypair files stored to disk (under invstigation if ***both*** keypair files are encrypted - only private key is enough).
3. **Communication on state channels for cooperating nodes** - this is potentially an asset (according to [issue#2](https://github.com/ThomasArts/aetmodel/issues/2), but is unconfirmed and needs further investigation.
4. **Tokens** are an expression of value in the system.
Control over tokens that belong to an account should be unconditionally linked to the respective account's private key.
5. **Computational power** - we consider Tokens and computational power equivalent in the context of the Aeternity blockchain.

## Assumptions

**Assumptions** about the system model and about the way users will interact with the system.

1. **The user model is completely flat**, there is only one type of users in the system, all users have equal privileges.
	* To be discussed

2. **Security of Epoch nodes** relies on the security of the compilation toolchain.

3. **Security of Epoch nodes** relies on the absence of malicious Erlang nodes running on the same platform.

### FALSE Assumptions
1. **A node's private key** is the only data that must remain secret at all times   

	* 	FALSE, based on [issue #2](https://github.com/ThomasArts/aetmodel/issues/2): The messages exchanged in a state channel should be private—as long as peers cooperate—, i.e. MitM should not be possible.


2. **All code runs in the same privilege ring**, i.e. all code on the epoch nodes has the same privilege level.

	* FALSE, based on [issue #3](https://github.com/ThomasArts/aetmodel/issues/3): the AEVM executes untrusted code and EoP should not be possible.


## Threat Model

The threat model described in this document is based on three artifacts:

### 1. The **STRIDE** model:   

STRIDE is a mnemonic for things that go wrong in computer and network systems security [1],[2].
It stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
We base the threat model described in this document on an adaptation of the STRIDE methodology.
A virtualization of the threat trees will be added in the future if necessary.

* **(1) Spoofing** - Impersonating something or someone else.  
* **(2) Tampering** - Modifying data (transaction content?) or code.   
* **(3) Repudiation** - Claiming	to	have not performed an action.   
* **(4) Information disclosure** - Exposing information to someone not authorized to see it.  
* **(5) Denial of service** - Deny or	degrade service to users.  
* **(6) Elevation of privilege** -  Gain capabilities without proper authorization

### 2. Earlier threat model work on Bitcoin
Earlier work has been done on the [Bitcoin threat model](https://github.com/JWWeatherman/bitcoin_security_threat_model).
We have reviewed and adapted the parts that were considered relevant to Aeternity.

### 3. Previous Work on Threat Model
Earlier work has been done on a [thread model for Aeternity](https://github.com/Aeternity/protocol/blob/master/SYNC.md#threat-model).
We revised the updated information and relevant aspects and included them into the current threat model.

### (2) Tampering
Tampering is closely related to spoofing and information disclosure.

		(2.1) Connection tampering
			(2.1.1) No connection integrity
			(2.1.2) Weak connection integrity;
			(2.1.3) Connection security compromise;
		(2.2) Tampering with message integrity

		(2.3) Tampering with the ordering of transactions included in a block
			[2.3.1] Tampering the timestamp in mined blocks
		(2.4) Tampering with block validity
			(2.4.1) No verification of block validity
			(2.4.2) Weak verification of block validity
		(2.5) Tampering with transaction validity

* **Note 2.2: on (2.8) Code Tampering**
The epoch node software is open source and constructed using other open source components or libraries.
* **Note 2.3: on (2.8.5) Colocated Erlang nodes**
***Any*** Erlang node on the same platform can interact with the Epoch nodes

### (3) Repudiation
To be extended once the implementation of bitcoin-NG is stable.

	(3.1) Repudiating a future commitment
	(3.2) Repudiating a past transaction
		(3.2.1) Repudiating a past off-chain transaction
		(3.2.2) Repudiating a past on-chain transaction
				(3.2.2.1) Repudiating timely reception of an oracle response
				(3.2.2.2) Repudiating late submission of an oracle response

### (4) Information Disclosure

Considering that all information added to the blockchain is public, the scope of information disclosure is significantly reduced.

The working assumption is that the only data that must remain secret at all times are the private keys of nodes (see Assumptions above) and the private keys of the accounts, oracles, and contracts.
The threats to the confidentiality and integrity of the node private keys are listed in the ***Spoofing*** threat tree.

Hence, if the assumption is correct, the information disclosure threat tree is a subtree of the ***Spoofing*** threat tree

Update 2018-07-02, based on [issue#2](https://github.com/ThomasArts/aetmodel/issues/2) ***The messages exchanged in a state channel should be private — as long as peers cooperate —, i.e. MitM should not be possible***, i.e. assumption  1 is false.

Threat tree for threat vector (4): Information Disclosure.

	(4.1) Disclosure of messages in a state channel.
		(4.1.1) Adversary performs a MitM attack on the state channel to breach communication confidentiality and integrity;
		(4.1.2) Forcing early arbitration to breach communication confidentiality;


### (5) Denial of service

##### 1. Overloading with transactions
Creating and posting a transaction is a computationally cheap action for an attacker. A valid transaction is a transaction that can potentially be included in a future block and that a miner receives a fee for.
Validation of a transaction is computational cheap, but having to validate many transactions that cannot be included in a block, is a computational overhead for a node. If an attacker could
post enormous amounts of transactions to the network, it could potentially impact the rate in which correct transactions are accepted.
Transactions may validate but nevertheless not be possible to include in a block. For example, an attacker could post a spend-transaction including more tokens than the from account contains. This transaction is then kept in the transaction pool for a while and *check this* validated for each new block candidate.  
By posting enormous amounts of transactions to the network, the pool of transactions kept to be included in the next block could grow beyond memory capacity causing the node to crash or possible valid transactions being pruned. Additionally the network capacity could be overloaded and therefore distribution of possible valid transactions be impacted as propagation of these may be delayed or stopped.

	(5.1) Posting invalid transactions.
	(5.2) Posting unusable transactions
			[5.2.1] Resubmitting unusable transactions directly to a node
			[5.2.2] Gossiping unusable transactions through the p2p network (related to 5.4.2.1)
	(5.3) Exploiting memory limitations
		(5.3.1) Memory leaks in cleaning transaction pool
		(5.3.2) Overloading memory with atoms
		(5.3.3) Overloading memory with non-garbage-collected processes
	(5.4) Exploiting network or communication vulnerabilities to degrade or deny service
		(5.4.1) Launch Eclipse attacks against a node or a set of nodes
			(5.4.1.1) Eclipse by connection monopolization
			(5.4.1.2) Eclipse by owning the table
			(5.4.1.3) Eclipse by manipulating time
			(5.4.1.4) Obtain node 'secret' used to determine peer selection from unverified pool
		(5.4.2) Network-wide attacks against the Aeternity network
			(5.4.2.1) Attacks to slow down the Aeternity network
		    (5.4.2.2) Flooding the network with unresponsive nodes
		(5.4.3) Denial of Service against predefined peer nodes
			(5.4.3.1) Denial of Service using API functionality
			(5.4.3.2) Denial of Service using generic DoS methods
	(5.5) Exploiting software vulnerabilities to degrade or deny service
		(5.5.1) Improper check for unusual or exceptional condition
	(5.6) Exploiting epoch protocol vulnerabilities to degrade or deny service.
		(5.6.1) Refusing to cooperate after having opened the channel;  
		(5.6.2) Refusing to sign a multi-party transaction;
		(5.6.3) Open channels up to the full capacity of the node;
		(5.6.4) Dropping messages on a state channel;
		(5.6.5) Exploiting errors in the contract language to run contracts without gas;

### (6) Elevation of privilege
The working assumption is that the user model is flat, i.e. there is no difference between the privileges of any two nodes.
Hence, if the assumption is correct, the elevation of privilege threat tree only applies to underlying environment and is orthogonal to the software developed in this project.

**Update 2018-07-02** Assumption is FALSE, since [the AEVM executes untrusted code](https://github.com/ThomasArts/aetmodel/issues/3)

**discuss** As long as the network is small, there is a concept of Aeternity owned nodes that would be more "trustable" than other nodes. In the beginning it might be important to prevent a small different subset of nodes to take the role as trusted set to connect to.  

* Indeed, this falls under the threat of ["altcoin infanticide"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56675.0).


	(6.1) EoP on the epoch node.
		(6.1.1)	Exploitable vulnerabilities in AEVM leading to EoP
		(6.1.2) Exploit Erlang distribution to get access to node
	(6.2) EoP in p2p network
		(6.2.1) EoP of an arbitrary node to status of trusted node
				(6.2.1.1) EoP though exploitabtion of API vulnerabilities;
				(6.2.1.2) EoP through forged Epoch node distributions;

## STRIDE Threat Trees

For each threat tree, the tables below describe the ***leaf*** nodes AND parent nodes with ***one*** leaf.
As a rule, when a leaf node becomes a parent it is replaced by one or more leaf node entries, except when justified by generic mitigation strategies (to avoid duplication).

| 5.1  | Posting invalid transactions  | The node that receives a transaction validates this transaction. Invalid transactions are rejected and never propagated to other nodes.  | Handling the http request is more work than validating the transaction.

## Questions and concerns

1. Reusing cryptographic keys for different functions is considered bad practice but [commonly done in public key cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/RealWorldCrypto/slides/kenny.pdf).
Considering that the "Private Keys" (see **Assets**) are used to both authenticate nodes and authorize transactions, it is **essential** to review the security of this reuse pattern.

* The ***privilege levels*** is the system must be documented to add further details to the threat model.

* Password for keypair protection stored in CONFIG file OR as an environment variable is NOT a good practice (example in aec_keys:start_worker/0; config in epoch_config_schema.json)

* In epoch_config_schema.json: "Password used to encrypt the peer key-pair files - if left blank `password` will be used." ***Such defaults provide a false sense of security and should not be used.***
* In epoch_config_schema.json: "used to encrypt the peer key-pair files" - it does not make sense to encrypt the public key file (investigate if that is actually done).

	"peer_password" : {
			"description" :
			"Password used to encrypt the peer key-pair files - if left blank `password` will be used",
			"type" : "string"
		}
* **[Discussion]** In aec_peers, '-type peer\_id(): What is the consideration behind using the public key (and not e.g. a hash of it) as peer id?

* **[Discussion]** In epoch_config_schema.json: ***Is it intended that the default contradicts the comment?***
	  "extra_args" : { "description" : "Extra arguments to pass to the miner executable binary. The safest choice is specifying no arguments i.e. empty string.",
		                                    "type" : "string",
		                                    "default": "-t 5"
		                                },

* **[Discussion]** In epoch_config_schema.json: ***consider placing such controls in a separate file - otherwise there is a high risk of deliberately misleading users to make damaging changes, this can damage availability.***
		"node_bits" : {
		"description" : "Number of bits used for representing a node in the Cuckoo Cycle problem. It affects both PoW generation (mining) and verification. WARNING: Changing this makes the node incompatible with the chain of other nodes in the network, do not change from the default unless you know what you are doing.",
		                                    "type": "integer",
		                                    "default": 28
